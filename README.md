# AirplaneBoardingSim
A simulation framework that can test the performance of various airplane boarding methods. It also includes a built-in visualization tool that can animate the boarding process and save a movie. 

A few tips to use it:

1. Change the method variable to test different methods. To see which methods are built-in, check under the AssignSeats function.
2. If the 'ac.repeat' variable is set to 1, the simulation is performed only once and the visual is made. If 'ac.repeat' is set to more than 1, the simulation is performed more than once and the visual is not made. 
3. Hence if you want the visual to be made, set 'ac.repeat' to 1.
4. The program by default saves a move. If you don't want it to, comment the very last line of the program.
